# IoT Smart Home Dashboard: High-Level Architecture and Setup Guide

This document outlines a **step-by-step** approach to building an IoT Smart Home Dashboard using:
- **React** for the **frontend** (via *Create React App*).
- **.NET Core Web API** for the **backend**.
- **Bootstrap** for styling.
- **CORS** configurations to allow communication between frontend and backend.

---
## 1. Overall Architecture

1. **Frontend Layer (React)**  
   - A single-page application (SPA) built with React.  
   - Responsible for user interface, routing (if applicable), and making REST API calls to the backend.  
   - Can leverage Bootstrap for layout and styling.  
   - Communicates with the backend via Axios (or similar HTTP client) over standard HTTP/HTTPS.

2. **Backend Layer (.NET Core Web API)**  
   - Provides RESTful APIs for user authentication, device management, sensor data retrieval, and automation controls.  
   - Implements CORS to allow requests from the React frontend.  
   - Potentially includes **JWT authentication** for secure endpoints and **SignalR** (or another WebSocket solution) for real-time updates.

3. **Database**  
   - Stores user information, device details, sensor readings, and logs.  
   - Accessed by the backend via an ORM or direct SQL queries (implementation depends on choice of database engine).

4. **Real-Time Communication**
   - Implemented using *SignalR*, enabling push notifications and real-time sensor data updates.

## 2. Project Directory Structure

Below is a recommended directory layout that separates concerns and improves maintainability:
```
IoT-Smart-Home-Dashboard/
├── backend/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   ├── Models/
│   ├── Services/
│   ├── Data/
│   ├── appsettings.json
│   ├── Program.cs
│   ├── Startup.cs
├── frontend/
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── pages/
│   │   ├── redux/
│   │   ├── App.js
│   │   ├── index.js
├── database/
│   ├── schema.sql
├── docs/
│   ├── API_Documentation.md
│   ├── Setup_Guide.md
├── tests/
│   ├── api-tests/
│   ├── unit-tests/
├── deployment/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── kubernetes.yml
```



**Key Folders:**
- **backend**: Contains the .NET Core Web API, organized into folders for controllers (where endpoints reside), models (data structures), services (business logic), etc.
- **frontend**: Holds the React application, including components, pages, and any state management setup.
- **database**: Contains SQL scripts or database configuration files.
- **docs**: Documentation artifacts (API docs, setup guide).
- **tests**: Collection of test scripts for API tests and unit tests.
- **deployment**: Infrastructure-as-code files (Docker, Kubernetes, or other deployment configurations).

## 3. Backend Setup (ASP.NET Core)

### 3.1 Creating a .NET Core Web API Project

1. **Initialize a Web API** in a new folder (named `backend`).
2. **Add Essential Packages** (if necessary), such as:
   - *JWT Authentication* libraries (for token-based security).
   - *CORS* (to allow cross-origin requests from the React app).
   - *SignalR* (if you plan to implement real-time functionalities).

### 3.2 Configuring the Web API

1. **Enable CORS**: Configure the project to allow HTTP requests from the React application domain (e.g., `localhost:3000` during development).
2. **Implement JWT**: If using JSON Web Tokens, set up token validation parameters and ensure secure handling of keys.
3. **Define Controllers** for:
   - **Authentication** (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/register`)  
   - **Device Management** (`/api/devices` endpoints)  
   - **Sensor Data** (`/api/sensors/...`)  
   - **Automation Controls** (`/api/control/...`)
4. **Map Endpoints**: Ensure each feature has a corresponding route under `/api/...`.

### 3.3 Data Handling

1. **Database**: Connect to a relational or NoSQL database. Use an ORM (such as Entity Framework) or direct SQL queries.
2. **Models**: Represent database tables and data transfer objects (DTOs) for clarity.
3. **Services**: Encapsulate business logic (e.g., device discovery, sensor data processing, user management).

### 3.4 Optional Real-Time Updates (SignalR)

1. **Add a Hub**: Create a SignalR Hub to push notifications or sensor updates in real-time.
2. **Client Integration**: The React frontend can subscribe to this hub to receive immediate updates without polling.

## 4. Frontend Setup (React)

### 4.1 Creating a React App

1. Initialize a React application using cra (named `frontend`).
2. Directory structure typically includes:
   - **components**: Reusable UI blocks.
   - **pages**: Container-level components or route pages.
   - **redux**: If using Redux for application state management.
   - **utils** or **services**: For HTTP requests and helper functions.

### 4.2 Installing Frontend Dependencies

1. **Bootstrap**: For quick and responsive UI design.
2. **Axios** (or similar): For performing HTTP requests to the .NET API.
3. **React Router DOM**: For client-side routing (e.g., navigate between dashboard pages).

### 4.3 Configuring HTTP Calls

1. **Create a Utility Layer** to manage all API calls, simplifying the process of setting base URLs and attaching tokens (if using JWT).
2. **Components** can import this utility to fetch or update data, minimizing duplication of request logic.

### 4.4 Implementing Key UI Features

1. **Authentication Views**: 
   - Login page to authenticate users and store JWT locally.
   - Registration page for new users.
2. **Dashboard**:
   - Real-time sensor data (temperature, humidity, security alerts).
   - Device controls (lights, thermostats, door locks).
   - Notification area for warnings (e.g., security breaches, power spikes).
3. **Styling & Layout**:
   - Use Bootstrap classes to rapidly create a responsive layout.
   - Combine with custom CSS if needed for branding.

### 4.5 Handling Security & CORS

1. **CORS**: Confirm the backend is configured to accept requests from your React app's domain.
2. **JWT**: Ensure requests to protected API endpoints include the token in the correct header (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).

---
## 5. Integration Flow

1. **Launch the Backend**: Run the .NET Core Web API, which listens on a specified port (e.g., `https://localhost:5001` or a similar URL).
2. **Launch the Frontend**: Run the React development server (commonly at `http://localhost:3000`).
3. **Configure Environment**:
   - Point the React app to the backend URL in a configuration file or environment variables.
   - Validate the endpoints by performing sample requests (e.g., fetching device list).

---
## 6. Testing & Validation

### 6.1 API Testing

1. **Postman or Swagger**:  
   - Verify each endpoint (`/api/auth/login`, `/api/devices`, etc.) returns the correct data and handles errors properly.
   - Confirm JWT tokens are issued on successful login and required for protected routes.

2. **API Tests**:  
   - Automate test scripts in a `tests/api-tests` folder.  
   - Check for edge cases (invalid credentials, device not found, etc.).

### 6.2 Frontend Testing

1. **Unit Tests**:  
   - Create test files for individual components/pages to verify UI rendering and logic.
2. **Integration Tests**:  
   - Simulate user flows (login, device toggle, data refresh).
3. **User Acceptance**:  
   - Validate the dashboard’s look and feel, as well as the real-time functionality if SignalR is used.

## 7. Summary of the Process

1. **Establish the Project Structure**: Keep backend, frontend, and resources separated for clarity.
2. **Setup the ASP.NET Core Web API**:  
   - Configure CORS, JWT authentication, and relevant endpoints.  
   - Implement the domain logic in controllers, models, and services.
3. **Build the React Application**:  
   - Structure UI into components/pages.  
   - Use Axios for API interaction, and ensure JWT tokens are handled properly.  
   - Style with Bootstrap for consistent design.
4. **Test Thoroughly**:  
   - Ensure endpoints and UI flows work as intended (use Postman, Swagger, and React testing tools).  
   - Confirm real-time features to include SignalR.


By following these architectural guidelines and the recommended structure, you will have a robust foundation for your IoT Smart Home Dashboard. This layout ensures modularity, scalability, and maintainability, making it easier to add new features and integrate with additional IoT devices in the future.
